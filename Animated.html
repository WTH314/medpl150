     This project involved learning to create animated GIFs in Photoshop and Illustrator. The core technique mirrors traditional flipbook animation, where individual layers represent sequential frames of motion. By adjusting the timing between these frames, I controlled the animation's pace to achieve a natural and viewable result. I created two distinct GIFs. The first GIF I call The Blinking Eye: I first designed the eye asset in Illustrator, creating three separate layers to depict the stages of a blink: open, half-closed, and closed. Importing these into Photoshop, I sequenced them into a looping animation. The final effect brings the illustrated eye to life, creating an animated, blinking, and expressive feeling as if it's looking back at the viewer with an emotion

     The second GIF I call it The Playful Dog. For this GIF, I used Photoshop's Puppet Warp tool to manipulate a photo of my dog, creating a walking and jumping motion. The goal was to transform a static photograph into a lively 2D animation. By placing him in a park setting, I created a narrative where he appears to be walking forward and climbing a tree. I chose this subject because I believed the movement would capture his playful and cute character. Overall, this assignment was an engaging introduction to 2D animation principles. It demonstrated how to effectively bring static objects to life and highlighted the importance of technical details like frame delay, where a speed that is too fast blurs and one that is too slow fails to create the illusion of movement.
