    The reason I chose to do these two emotions(anger and fear) is easy to create, and people can look at the eye expression just by looking at the color of the image. The red and yellow colors can be associated with anger, and the blue and purple can be associated with fear. The complementary colors that I have used are orange and blue, purple and yellow. Also, the eyebrow is the main thing that can bring the eye to look and feel like it has emotion. Also, I have used a different shape to create the eyelid and eyebrow. I put some eyelash on the eye to make the eye stay out more. Also, the eyes I have created are more like cartoon-like eyes. Also, I use the Grid, Rulers to help with my image alignment. So the eyes will look more even.
