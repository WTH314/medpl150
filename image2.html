   The reason I picked this photo is that the colors and the lighting can get the viewer's attention at the red fire hydrant, stand out from the background color, making it easy for people to notice the main point of the photo. Also, the background looks like it has the color green, which helps to enhance the red color from the fire hydrant because in the wheel of a circle, the color red is opposite of green, which will cause the high contrast focal point. I crop the image so I follow the rule of thirds. I edit the tone by having more shadow at the back and making the light look like it shines from above the fire hydrant, so you will see more clearly where the shadow is showing on the fire hydrant. I also chose to photograph the fire hydrant because it can save lives if a fire breaks out in the building, which is why I think it's important to have a fire hydrant in the building.
