   The pie graph shows amount favorite snacks of people, which you can eat. More people prefer to eat potato chips as a snack, and you can see that not a lot of people eat nuts as a snack or fruit snacks. The other pie graph shows the number of snacks a person has for a day. You can see that a lot of people eat one or two snacks a day, and what surprises me the most is that someone will eat 7 or more snacks in a day.

  The Bar graph shows the popular drinks that people will go with when they eat their snack. You can see that a lot of people will drink water with their snack. The number of people who drink coffee and juice was snack is the same as the number of people who pick these options. The other Bar graph shows the location that people pick to eat their snack. You can see that a lot like to eat their snack in their room more than in class or the living room, or the kitchen. Also, the same number of people prefer to eat in the kitchen and the living room.
