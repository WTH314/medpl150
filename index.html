  <h1>yingxin's MEDPL150 portfolio</h1>


  <p>Welcome to my portfolio website for MEDPL 150.</p>


  <h2>Creative Statement</h2>

  <p> My name is Yingxin Liang. My pronouns are she/her. I am a Hunter College student right now; I am in my junior year. I am an emerging media major. I was born in China and lived there for a few years before moving to the United States. The reason I want to get into a media major is that I want my future job to be about designing for a company with technology or something to do with marketing. I did self taught myself a little bit about how to code with HTML and CSS by watching YouTube videos. Also, I learn how to code with C++ and Python from the computer science class I have taken. But I think learning HTML is much easier to understand than C++.

 </p>

  <p>My hobby is drawing. I can draw anime style and 3D shapes, build things with LEGO, watch anime, and read manga. Also, I like to cook new food because I like to try to taste different flavors of food from different cultures. And I like to try new things because that is how I can grow as a person, and I would like to learn new things. My movie genre it hat I like is comedy and horrible because they make me happy. The thing I like to watch is YouTubers playing video I like the mostly when they play horror video games because horror also has a theory behind which makes it interesting, and I like it when horror video games surprise ending.

  <h2>Reflection</h2>

  <p> The thing I hope to learn from the media class is how to have a better understanding of using HTML and CSS. Also, I can learn how to use Photoshop and edit video. Maybe I can find an internship in the media department. My opinion about code it that they are complicated in someway because they alway a new way to code and when I was learning to code it see boring because you can’t see your result of you code unless you finish writing the code but when you make a small like a lowercase and uppercase which can get you an error when you code so you will need to find these small mistake so then you code will work if not then you can’t make it work.

    Also, I want to learn more about website code that can help with design using technology. And I like the part of Hunter College that allows us to use website design for free when we are students in Hunter College. Also, I wish to learn more about the technology that helps with design, so it can help me in the future to find a job in my major and get some experience from the things I learn in class. Also, to begin building my portfolio in design using technology. This course site will serve as a portfolio of my experiments and reflections, and it can capture the growth I have made within the class and expand my skills in developing as a visual communicator.
