            <p>Red door: open and see a cave with one long path then you continue to follow the path. Then you see a giant dog sleeping.</p>
            
            <p>Then you try to pet the dog. Then the dog wakes up from your scent then starts to growl at you. Then the dog attacked.</p>
            
            <p>You actually think it is a great idea to pet someone's dog without the owner allowing it. If the dog attacks you it's your fault for petting anything that you think looks cute without thinking twice if the dog is friendly or not to humans.</p>
