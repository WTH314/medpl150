            <p>You pick this choice. Why do you even look for the cave from the beginning when you are going to back out now that you just dumped it? You can waste your time doing something else, but you just choose to do this. </p>
            
            <p> congrats, you win the reward for wasting my time and yours, and also being chicken, afraid of taking risks in life.</p>
            
            <p>The smart part about this decision is that you know  life is too precious to put at risk</p>
