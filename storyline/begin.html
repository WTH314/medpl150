            <p>You look around and finally find the cave called “their no end” you have been looking for. Also, there is a sign that says, “If you die in the cave, people will not look for your dead body, so choose wisely”.</p>
            
            <p>The reason you look for the cave called 'there's no end' is because you heard a rumor about the cave that can grant you any wish you can wish for. That made you want to find the cave so that it could grant your wish to come true.</p>
            
            <p>But the people did warn you that when you enter the cave, there will only be one exit, and when you enter the cave, you can’t back out of it. So you need to survive to the end, which means the are two ways to escape the cave is by finding the right path to the exit in the cave or by death.</p>
