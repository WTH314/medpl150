  <h1>Reflection 3 â€“ Photography & Photoshop Depth of field</h1>

  <p>
    This week I learn about using a camera to create the Depth of field by using the wide aperture(low f-stop) and proper focusing techniques. Also, they have two types of Depth of field: one called shallow, where the object is force point and the background will need to be blurred so the object can be isolated from the background. Another type is the Deep, which has both Foreground and background that can be seen clearly. You get deep by high f-stop and move the camera further out from the main object so you can have the image background and the foreground to see clearly. For a shallow photo, you need to have a low f-stop and the camera needs to move closer to the object, so you make the object clearer, and you can make the background more blurred.

   Photoshop depth of field: when you make a deep photo look more shallow, you need to pick a main object in the photo, then you blur the background. Also, Photoshop can get the photo more using artifacts to create it, so it is unnatural, unlike using the camera to take a photo with a shallow depth of field. But using Photoshop can help us to edit the thing we want to be blurred better than using a camera to find a good angle to get a perfectly blurred background and a clear image of the foreground, which can take some time to get the right photo. And using Photoshop may take less time to get the image to look like it is in a shallow depth of field.
