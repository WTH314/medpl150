  <h1>Reading 2 – Reflection motherhood stories <em> My stolen future story of Heel</em></h1>

  <p>
    I think for this story that illustration was being used because it makes people pay attention and are more interested in seeing what happens than just imagining what happens in the story. Also illustration can get someone to stay longer for the story because the illustration can get a person's attention faster than reading from an article. Also, illustrations can get anyone in a different age range to read without someone knowing English, or they word can may understand how the character feels in the story when they look at the illustration. The story doesn’t have an illustration; they have some real photographs and videos to show people that this story is a real story that actually happened in real life.

  Like in the beginning of the story “My stolen future” where you have to use illustration to tell the story to its reader, but when you get close to the end of the story, when Heel talks to one of the Rainbo center staff start to use photographs; they continue to draw Heel as an illustration. Toward the end, you will see a video you have the same Rainbo center staff explain the truth about a lot of this type of story happening, and kind of sad because of the girls' need to give up on education just to raise the kids they have. The video and the photograph have brought more proof that this story is just a fan fiction, and it is a real story that happens to people there.

  <P>
 The difference between the illustration and the photographs is that illustration, people draw the character, but they don’t always capture what the person looks like and the facial expression, whereas in a photograph, you can capture what the person looks like and the emotion that the character is feeling right now.  Also, illustrations don’t capture the environment or background as well as the photographs, which can show more detail about the environment and tell about the person's background, like the type of place the character is living in. In the illusion for Heel, the only thing I can get from looking at the background is that she lives in a place that has a lot of green trees and grass.

  The advantage of their presence in comparison to text-only or photography is that it can make the reader's experience more engaging. If a story only has text, it can be difficult for the reader to stay interested, as sometimes images are needed to capture their attention. However, if you only have photography, the reader may misunderstand the photograph if it doesn’t include any accompanying words. If the author wants the reader to understand the message they are trying to give to the reader. They will need to put some words in their work so the reader will not overthink what message the author wants the reader to understand or what they want us to see or learn from the photograph. Like in one of the photographs, where the heel is talking with the  Rainbo center staff, without words to explain what happens, the reader will think that the Heel is just having a normal conversation with an adult in her family about something. So it is important to include text in a photograph.
