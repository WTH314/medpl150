  <h1>Image 1 (1920 Ã— 1080 Crop)</h1>

  <img src="image/imageA.jpg" alt="1920x1080" width="600">

  <p>
    I chose this image for the crop and edited the tone because I think it is the strongest out of the. Five I have taken. The image shows an exit sign and some words on the wooden board on the wall. I use level edit to make the opposite of the exit darker, so the exit sign will pop out when people look at the image. And I have used the Curves edit to make the background darker so the light from the exit will shine brighter. And put more brightness next to the exit sign to make the sign brighter for the people to see. Also, I have cropped the photo to follow the rule of thirds. I make the exit sign the focus point in the photo. Also, I chose to take a photo of the exit sign because I understand the importance of exit when an emergency happens, and the exit sign shows people where to go to escape from the emergency when it happens in the building.
