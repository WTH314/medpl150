  <h1>Reading 1 – Reflection on Susan Sontag, <em>On Photography</em></h1>

  <p>
    The author Sontag, in “In Plate’s Cave,” argues that photography can have a profound impact on people's perception and knowledge regarding photography. She uses Plato's allegory of the cave as a metaphor in the article. She explains that humans are trapped in a world(photographs), where they have mistaken the photographs for being real life. Also, photography can serve as a tool to show the power, regret, surveillance, and can convict people.
  </p>
  <P>To capture an image, according to Sontag, is an act of appropriation and power. When we take a photograph, we will always try to find the right angle or frame to take the photograph. And the way each person takes the photograph has their own style and perspective on the photo they are taking, which tries to claim that they own the photograph, which makes it sound like the person taking the photograph is violating the object or person in the image. Some people may think that a camera-only job is just capturing objective reality, but in truth, the way someone takes the photo can change its view and change the meaning of the photo. Also, with the combination of photographs, they can transform the simple image into a complex nature of reality, use it to construct our identity and our understanding of the world.

  </p>Photography shapes the way we view the world by creating a new view that can lead us to believe that life is composed of events worth photographing, Some example that the author use to prove their point by showing us the photographs taken in wartime or some sports events is just some interesting event that need to captured which show is kind of a way to be dehumanizing effect, reducing the profound human suffering. Furthermore, photographs can shape people's minds very easily. Photographs can bring light to thing that is injustice that happen in the world by allowing people to see the injustice that is happening, which can lead people to fight for the cause of the problem. But we look deep into the story behind the photo because the person who is taking the photo knows that it will get more people to view the photo if it is about the suffering of the person in the photo, which can become consumers of suffering and not activists against it. We use photography not only to remember the past but also to tell us that the world is constantly disappearing.
  </p>
  <p>We represent the present moment through photography, illustration, or image + text, by combining image and background text so people can view the image and understand the meaning behind the image. Also, the text can make the image more understandable for people to look at the image without misunderstanding the message the people who took the photograph and the message the person is trying to convey to the viewer, so they can understand why the person has taken a photo of that event to bring a message to the viewer without misunderstanding the creator.
