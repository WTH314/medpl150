  <h1>Reading 4 – Reflection  W. J. Hennigan, NY Time <em> The Rising Risk, and How We Stop It</em></h1>

  <p>
     This artwork is being told like a pop book with journalistic writing. I like art that makes you feel like you're in a cartoon world, with the art jumping onto your face. Also, they do that type of artwork to get the reader's attention better than allowing the reader to read like an article. The article mainly talks about how the war can affect both sides of the community and the people who live during that time. The author mainly wants to bring attention to the bad things that happen in war. An example of a part that made the reader feel like they had witnessed the bomb drop because you see a burst of light in front of your face. Then you see fire everywhere, with objects flying off the place. And the bright red color in the artwork makes it look like it is dangerous because red color symbolizes with dangerous. This can tell the reader that using nuclear weapons in war is very dangerous. The more I look at this, it makes it feel like a 3D movie.

   Then they have included a map which shows that nuclear weapons have been created more over time because the country governments think the country with the most nuclear weapons will have more power. In the 20s country do started to decrease the creation of nuclear weapons, but they still had nuclear power. I like that the author has included some rain motion in the artwork, which makes it look like it is raining in the 2D drawing of the death sunflower. Also, the author has included real-life video of a big missile that the country like China, North Korea, India, and Pakistan have created to show to the public, so the other country will think twice before attacking them. The author mainly war it talk about the war between Ukraine and Russia, which Russia was about to use nuclear weapons if the other country joined in the war with the Ukrainian side. Which can the NATO to worry about the aftereffects if Russia creates a war because of the damage and the deaths that can happen everywhere, and not just in Ukraine and Russia. Which at that time causes people to panic because of don't know what will happen next. Also, the author has talked about the history past when a nuclear war almost happened during the Cold War.


  <P>
 The author's main colors used in the artwork are red, yellow, and orange. The reason could be that the author uses these colors most it does because these are the colors that showcase destruction. The author has shown a real-life video of the country's government talking about the war, which showcases that everything that the author is saying is real and has been proven. The author differed from the other people who wrote articles in that the author has included artwork which allows people to understand the dangers of nuclear weapons and the effect they can have on the environment in Firsthand, see the damage that is have caused the people.
