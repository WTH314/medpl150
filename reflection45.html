  <h1>Reflection 4 and 5 – Photomontage and illustrator</h1>

  <p>
    Doing week 4, we learn how to use photomontage for a project, which taught me how to put different things together to create something new, and I think the hard part is trying to find the right image for this project because when you look online, i hard to find an image you feel like going to work for my piece of work. But after you get an idea of what you want to put in, then everything looks easy. Also, the reason I picked the topic about pollution is because I feel like a lot of people don’t understand the importance of pollution to everyone, not just the animals in the sea also life, because we are all connected by the food cycle.

In week 5, I was taught how to use Adobe Illustrator, which helped me to make my work's photomontage message stand out because when I add the green circle on the first photomontage, people can understand that the water, which is being polluted, will not be a light color but may start to turn a darker color.  Also, I like the effect the green color has given to the image, which makes it look like it has two different colors in the image, like the top, the green is much darker than the green between the circles. Additionally, using Illustrator taught me how to use grids to create symmetry in the shapes I place onto the image and to create different color shadows within an object, or to put a word into a shape resembling the object.
