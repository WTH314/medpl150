    The art gallery I visited is New Art City (online). The art I will discuss is called “In-Between”; the reason I chose this one is because of the work's cover, which caught my attention. When I went into the artwork, I saw shapes stacked up together, which made it look like a puzzle without a wall.  When you look in the middle, you will see a map they have created, of which each part of the artwork has force on a different topic like media, image, etc. Like the color they use, which is brown and a little brown, which looks warm and comfortable like home. Each part of the artwork is credited to different people who talk about their lives or reflect on them. You get to see each person's different art style in this one big artwork. Also, the artwork includes 3D and 2D artwork combined.

     My favorite part of the artwork is the one that creates the house, and call is called “miniature”, which has different artwork in the house. They have a computer on a desk, and it is funny that they put toilet paper on the desk as well. Then, on the wall of the house, you will have four telephones on the wall. Then you look to the right, you will see a big glass bottle of pills next to it, and it looks like each pill in the bottle has a word on it. This is all on the first floor. The second floor of the wall has all of the artwork that is put to be display and a desk that has a monitor that have drawings on it, next to it looks like a place to read a book. I think the person creates this reflex in that person's life, like they have a place where they do their work, which can explain as less colorfull on the first floor than the second floor is where they relax and do what they want, like drawing and reading a book. Also on the side, it a board that has words that are opposite of each other, which reflects on the house that is built, like at the bottom, it shows daytime, and on the second floor, it shows nighttime.

  When you look at the bottom, you will see an alien spaceship flying around in that area. When you look closer, you will see a shrimp tempura flying the spaceship, which looks funny also, they have a message on it when you click on it, which says “hope you have a lovely time”. When you look even lower, you will see an artwork called “jet-head,” some spin work that looks like a two-transformer toy. One of the colors they use is green, and the other is turquoise. In the note, the person who wrote the note created it because they wanted to fight against boring reality with a cartoon-looking character. I agree with the idea that someone creates or imagines a cartoon in our mind just to get through the boring and repetitive life of the day.
